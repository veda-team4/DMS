## What is DMS?
DMS is an abbreviation for ***D***river ***M***onitoring ***S***ystem. DMS is a safety system that uses a dashboard-mounted camera to detect driver drowsiness and issues an audio alarm and warning light to help the driver regain concentration.

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 to detect in real time whether the driver's eyes are closed or head is down. If the system detects the driver is drowsy, it uses LEDs and speakers to wake the driver up with visual and audible warnings.

Additionally, to alert surrounding vehicles that the driver is drowsy, the hazard lights turn on at the same time as the warning starts.
